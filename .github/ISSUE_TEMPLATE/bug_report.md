**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
If you'd like assistance, you will need to post a [minimal, complete, verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). (MCVE) Sometimes just by creating a MCVE you will actually discover the source of the problem yourself - or at least more details to help us reproduce it.

If you want some good examples of MCVE's, see a couple of issues that we have posted elsewhere, e.g:

 * https://github.com/videojs/video.js/issues/4765
 * https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming/issues/172

All of that detail is really important in getting help - especially on an open source plugin where people are donating their time. Without it we can't be sure what version of VideoJS you're using, or what other plugins you're using with it.

If you are unable to create an MCVE, you may still open a defect, but you must provide as much detail as possible. Defects opened without an MCVE have a much greater chance of being closed without investigation. Please remember: we are volunteers and do not have time to debug applications for every user that uses our plugins. If you show that you've put the effort into trying to debug it yourself and provide us with an MCVE and as much detail as possible, we will be much more interested in assisting you.
